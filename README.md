# UK Covid-19 Tracker Shiny App

A shiny app which pulls data from the PHE COVID-19 dashboard and plots the daily number of cases per test performed in the UK. 

This is currently deployed at https://bjeffrey1992.shinyapps.io/covid_tracker/.
However, it can also be run locally by firstly cloning this repo, sourcing `requirements.R` and then running `shiny::runApp(<path/to/covid_tracker>)` from within an R session.
